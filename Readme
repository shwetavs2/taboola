 Design three MySQL tables to store information about:
a. product: the “product” tables should include the name, category of the product; it
should also provide information to tell us when this product was added to the
table, and who added this product.
b. product price: this table will store the current price information of each product
and we should be able to join it with the product table. It should include the price,
current discount percent(default to 0), the updated time and who updated it.
c. product price change log: this table will store the old and new value of the
“product price” table that’s impacted by any insert/update/delete and contains
information of who and when the operation was performed.
Please list the table creation scripts in proper MySQL syntax for these three tables and a
query to join “product” table and “product price” table together to show the product name,
category, price, and who/when it gets updated.
